# Ranger Mini v3 hardware interface bring-up (run on the HOST, not in the container).
#
# Recreates the host-side interface configs that do NOT survive a host reboot or
# a container recreate, so `bash start.sh` inside the container finds everything
# ready. It is ADAPTIVE: it never trusts interface names, and it never requires a
# device to speak first before it is recognised.
#   * Lidar   — physical Ethernet ports come from sysfs (not a name regex); each
#               cabled port is probed ACTIVELY (own the host address, ping the
#               last known lidar address and the subnet broadcast, read the
#               neighbour table), then passively, then a single-cabled-port
#               fallback. Ports with no link are reported as NO CARRIER.
#   * Chassis — identified by DRIVER OWNERSHIP (the gs_usb interface), so it is
#               renamed and configured even while the chassis is silent; traffic
#               is checked afterwards as a diagnostic, not as a gate.

#   2. Chassis — the CAN port that carries chassis frames at the target bitrate

#   3. Camera  — Orbbec by USB vendor id 2bc5 (name-independent), verified only

# ── 1. Lidar NIC (adaptive) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Candidate = every PHYSICAL Ethernet port, decided from sysfs (type==1 ARPHRD_ETHER,
# a /device symlink, no /wireless dir) rather than by a name regex — a regex keeps
# leaking virtual interfaces (`can[0-9]` never matched the renamed `can_ranger`, so
# the CAN port was being probed as if it were an Ethernet port).
#
# Four passes, so a lidar that never announces itself, or that has moved address,
# is still found:
#   1. LIDAR_HOST_IP already live on a port  -> that port carries the lidar
#   2. ACTIVE  — own LIDAR_HOST_IP/CIDR on each cabled port, ping the last known
#                lidar address plus the subnet broadcast, then read the neighbour
#                table. This is what removes the dependency on the lidar speaking
#                first: a lidar answers ARP, it does not announce itself.
#   3. PASSIVE — the lidar's own ARP "who-has <host-ip>" or Livox UDP 5620x.
#   4. FALLBACK— exactly one cabled Ethernet port -> that must be the lidar
# Ports without carrier are reported as NO CARRIER instead of being sniffed in
# silence: "no traffic" and "no cable" are different faults and must read so.

# The chassis boots in CONTROL_MODE_STANDBY (0x00) and ignores every motion
# command until it is switched to CONTROL_MODE_CAN (0x01). ranger_base_node does
# send that switch once at startup (AgilexBase::EnableCommandedMode → CAN id
# 0x421, data 01 00 …), but a single lost frame leaves the car dead-silent with a
# perfectly healthy-looking bus, so assert the mode here on every run.
#
# The frame is lost when the gs_usb TX path has wedged: the driver leaks echo
# slots ("Unexpected unused echo id N" in dmesg), stops the queue for good, and
# every write() then returns ENOBUFS while RX keeps working and the TX packet
# counter freezes. Only a link down/up releases the slots, so probe TX first and
# reset the link ONLY when it is actually wedged — the reset drops the socket a
# running ranger_base_node holds, which then needs restarting.
